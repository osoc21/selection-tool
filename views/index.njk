        <p>
            Open Summer of Codes wants to compose the most successful team each year, osoc uses a self-made selection tool. This has worked fine until now, but there have been a few things missing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Osoc tries to make sure they have diverse teams. That is why during a period of 4 weeks team Sherlock, consisting of :
        </p>
            <ul class="intro__teamList list--simple">
            {% for student in team.students %}
                <li>
                    <a href="#{{student.firstname}}">
                        {{ student.firstname }} {{ student.lastname }} - student
                    </a>
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
            {% for coach in team.coaches %}
                <li>
                    <a href="#{{coach.firstname}}">
                        {{ coach.firstname }}  {{ coach.lastname }} - coach
                    </a>
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                We named ourself team <b>Sherlock</b>, dived into the research, worked together to improve the tool. The goal was a selection tool where recruiters have the opportunity to collaborate in real-time, find the best candidates and match them to the preferred team, resulting in more diverse and innovative teams.

    <h2 id="features"> Features / Improvements</h2>
    <p>
       Combining our strengths, we improved these factors in the tool:
    </p>
    <ul class="list--simple">
        <li>
            GDPR
        </li>
        <li>
            Diversity
        </li>
        <li>
            Inclusivity
        </li>
        <li>
            Application form
        </li>
        <li>
            User expererience
        </li>
        <li>
            Easier data management
        </li>
        <li>
            Automatisation
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GDPR</h3>
    <p>
        Using a form-provider to collect data from applicants, we ask them <b>a lot</b> of usefull information. All this information is very valuable to create teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Knowing all this, we made sure there were no leaks and removed or re-formed questions which could be in conflict with GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>Diversity</h3>
    <p>
        Diversity isn't just a <i>goal</i> to achieve when you have a business. We looked into each facet of diversity, had meetings with fellow osoc-students &amp; professionals who know the pitfalls and must-haves when you look into diversity.
    </p>

    <h3>Inclusivity</h3>
    <p>
        Everybody wants to be inclusive, this builds on top of diversity. Having an open mind for people around you and understanding where others would be left out because of decisions you make as a business.
    </p>
    <h3>Application form</h3>
    <p>
        Combining GDPR, diversity &amp; inclusivity, we made changes to the application-form. Below are a few examples
    </p>
    <div class="images-list">
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/application-form/question-1.png' | url }}" alt="question 1">
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/application-form/question-2.png' | url }}" alt="question 2">
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/application-form/question-3.png' | url }}" alt="question 3">
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/application-form/question-4.png' | url }}" alt="question 4">
        </figure>
    </div>
    
    <h3>User experience</h3>
    <p>
        After sending out a questionnaire to the coaches (users), we went through the feedback &amp; filtered out new improvements or features.
    </p>
    <div class="images-list images-gif">
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/user-experience/feat-1.gif' | url }}" alt="feature 1">
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/user-experience/feat-2.gif' | url }}" alt="feature 2">
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/user-experience/feat-3.gif' | url }}" alt="feature 3">
        </figure>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Easier data management</h3>
    <p>
        The project was build utilising firebase for data-management, however this isn't ideal for querying data. That's why we created a new PostgreSQL-database, querying it with GraphQL makes it more adjustable and customizable.
    </p>
    <div class="images-list">
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/data-management/firebase.png' | url }}" alt="data 1">
            <figcaption>Original Firebase</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="{{ '/assets/img/data-management/db-1.png' | url }}" alt="data 2">
            <figcaption>New PostgreSQL database</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Automatisation</h3>
    <p>
        We switched to the form-provider <i>Typeform</i>, which makes it possible to use a <b>webhook</b> that automatically adds new applicant-data in our database. This also allows no leaks on data-transfer.
    </p>
